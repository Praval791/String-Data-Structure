# String-Data-Structure
A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
I use this repository to share some the string related algorithms.
